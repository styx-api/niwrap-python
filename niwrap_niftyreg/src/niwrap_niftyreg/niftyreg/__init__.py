NiftyReg

NiftyReg is an open-source medical image registration toolkit that provides
tools for rigid, affine, and non-linear registration of medical images. It
implements a block-matching approach (reg_aladin) for global registration and a
fast free-form deformation algorithm based on cubic B-splines (reg_f3d) for
non-linear registration, with both CPU and GPU implementations. NiftyReg was
developed at the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC) at University College
London.
