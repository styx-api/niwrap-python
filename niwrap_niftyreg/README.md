# NiWrap wrappers for [NiftyReg](https://github.com/KCL-BMEIS/niftyreg)

NiftyReg is an open-source medical image registration toolkit that provides tools for rigid, affine, and non-linear registration of medical images. It implements a block-matching approach (reg_aladin) for global registration and a fast free-form deformation algorithm based on cubic B-splines (reg_f3d) for non-linear registration, with both CPU and GPU implementations. NiftyReg was developed at the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC) at University College London.

NiftyReg is made by https://github.com/KCL-BMEIS/niftyreg, http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/NiftyReg.

This package contains wrappers only and has no affiliation with the original authors.
