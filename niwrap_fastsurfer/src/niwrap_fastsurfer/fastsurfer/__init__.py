FastSurfer

FastSurfer is a fast and accurate deep-learning-based neuroimaging pipeline that
provides a full FreeSurfer alternative for volumetric analysis (via
FastSurferVINN) and surface-based thickness analysis (via recon-surf). It can
segment a whole brain MRI scan in under one minute on a GPU and produces
FreeSurfer-compatible outputs, making it a drop-in replacement for FreeSurfer's
recon-all pipeline. FastSurfer includes FastSurferVINN for whole brain
segmentation, CerebNet for cerebellum sub-segmentation, and HypVINN for
hypothalamus sub-segmentation.
