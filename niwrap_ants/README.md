# NiWrap wrappers for [ANTs](https://github.com/ANTsX/ANTs)

Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) computes high-dimensional mappings to capture the statistics of brain structure and function. It is a state-of-the-art medical image registration and segmentation toolkit that allows one to organize, visualize, and statistically explore large biomedical image sets. ANTs integrates imaging modalities in space and time and works across species or organ systems with minimal customization. It has won several international, unbiased competitions such as MICCAI, BRATS, and STACOM.
