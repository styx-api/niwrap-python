Greedy

Greedy is a tool for fast deformable registration of 2D and 3D medical images.
Developed at the Penn Image Computing and Science Lab (PICSL), it was designed
for really fast CPU-based deformable image registration in applications where
many images must be registered in parallel, such as multi-atlas segmentation.
Greedy borrows concepts from Symmetric Normalization (SyN) in ANTs but uses a
non-symmetric approach and highly optimized metric computation code for
additional speed.
