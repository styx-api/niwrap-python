It includes wb_view, a GUI-based visualization platform for exploring brain imaging data on cortical surfaces and volumes, and wb_command, a command-line program for performing algorithmic tasks using volume, surface, and grayordinate (CIFTI) data. wb_command is essential for running HCP minimal processing pipelines.
