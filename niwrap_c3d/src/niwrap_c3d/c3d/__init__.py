Convert3D

Convert3D (c3d) is a command-line tool for medical image processing that offers
complementary features to ITK-SNAP. It provides standard filters, resampling
commands, and tools specialized for multilabel and multicomponent images.
Through the use of reverse polish notation on the command line, c3d allows many
image processing tasks to be combined in small command-line mini-programs
without saving intermediate image files.
